# M5Stack Core 2 Stompinator

This little bad boy tracks your upstairs neighbor's stomping, shows it on the screen, and logs it to the SD card.

Load this up, stick the device on your ceiling, and cry because having a log showing how hard your neighbor stomps changes nothing.

## Usage

Create a file called `src/WiFiSecret.h` and define the following:

```c
#define SSID "mySSID"
#define PASSPHRASE "mySuperSecretPassphrase"
```
